A digital garden is not a blog. It's a space for ideas to grow, connect, and evolve over time. Unlike the chronological tyranny of traditional blogs, gardens embrace non-linearity.

Seeds become saplings become trees. Some wither. That's okay.

The garden metaphor reminds us that knowledge is organic, interconnected, and always in flux.
